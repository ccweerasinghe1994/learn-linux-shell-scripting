## Introduction
### What is Linux?
Linux is a generic term that refers to different open source
operating systems that are based on the Linux kernel. The Linux
kernel was originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, and
open sourced in 1996. A kernel is a piece of software that is
designed to act as an intermediate layer between low-level
hardware (such as the processor, memory, and input/output
devices) and high-level software, such as an operating system.
Apart from the Linux kernel, most Linux operating systems rely
heavily on GNU project utilities; for example, the Bash shell is a
GNU program. Because of this, Linux operating systems are
referred to by some as GNU/Linux. The GNU project, where
GNU stands for GNU's Not Unix! (a recursive acronym), is a
collection of free software, a lot of which is found in most Linux
distributions. This collection includes many tools, but also an
alternative kernel called GNU HURD (which is not as
widespread as the Linux kernel).
