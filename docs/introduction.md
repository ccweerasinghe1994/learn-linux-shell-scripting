## Introduction
### What is Linux?
Linux is a generic term that refers to different open source
operating systems that are based on the Linux kernel. The Linux
kernel was originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, and
open sourced in 1996. A kernel is a piece of software that is
designed to act as an intermediate layer between low-level
hardware (such as the processor, memory, and input/output
devices) and high-level software, such as an operating system.
Apart from the Linux kernel, most Linux operating systems rely
heavily on ```GNU``` project utilities; for example, the Bash shell is a
```GNU``` program. Because of this, Linux operating systems are
referred to by some as ```GNU```/Linux. The ```GNU``` project, where
```GNU``` stands for ```GNU```'s `Not Unix!` (a recursive acronym), is a
collection of free software, a lot of which is found in most Linux
distributions. This collection includes many tools, but also an
alternative kernel called ```GNU``` HURD (which is not as
widespread as the Linux kernel).

Why do we need a kernel? Since a kernel sits between hardware
and the operating system, it provides an abstraction for
interacting with hardware. This is why the Linux ecosystem has
grown so large: the kernel can be used freely, and it handles a lot
of low-level operations on many types of hardware. Creators of
an operating system can therefore spend their time making an
easy-to-use, beautiful experience for their users, instead of
having to worry about how the users' pictures are going to be
written to the physical disk(s) attached to the system.

The Linux kernel is so-called Unix-like software. As you might
suspect, this implies that it is similar to the original Unix kernel,which was created between 1971 and 1973 at Bell Labs, by Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. However, the Linux kernel is
only based on Unix principles and does not share code with Unix
systems. Famous Unix systems include the BSDs (FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, and so on) and macOS.

Linux operating systems are broadly used for one of two
purposes: as a desktop or as a server. As a desktop, Linux can
serve as a replacement for the more commonly used Microsoft
Windows or macOS. However, most Linux usage is accounted for
the server landscape. At the time of writing, it is estimated that
around 70% of all servers on the internet use a Unix or Unix-like
operating system. The next time you're browsing the news,
reading your mail, or are scrolling through your favorite social
media website, remember that there's a big chance the pages you
are being shown have been processed by one or more Linux
servers.

There are many distributions, or flavors, of Linux. Most Linux
operating systems fall within distribution families. A distribution
family is based on a common ancestor, and often use the same
package management tools. One of the more well-known Linux
distributions, Ubuntu, is based on the Debian distribution
family. Another prominent Linux distribution, Fedora, is based
on the Red Hat family. Other notable distribution families
include SUSE, Gentoo, and Arch.

Not many people realize how many devices run the Linux kernel.
For example, the most common smartphone operating system in
use today, Android (with a market share of around 85%), uses a
modified version of the Linux kernel. The same goes for many
smart TVs, routers, modems, and various other (embedded)
devices. If we were to include Unix and other Unix-like software,
we can safely say that most of the devices in the world run on
these kernels!
